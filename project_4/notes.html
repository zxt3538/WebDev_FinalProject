                    <a href = "index.html"> <h2>Home Page</h2> </a>
                    <p>The original idea for the home page came from an animation that I found on YouTube a while back. I wanted to replicate it in order to add some extra depth on the homepage so there's more for the user to interact with other than the links to the projects. <br>
                    The biggest challenege was formatting the mapping for the dots so that they fill the screen's width. Simply refreshing the page will adjust the canvas so it can properly read the mouse's position and perform the animation. <br>

                    <p>Originally, this section was supposed to be a space simulator where the user could control a rocket and fly around space using the mouse.<br>
                    But after dealing with SVG issues, I decided to build a ping pong game. The idea seemed more entertaining and had more creative input so I stuck with it. <br>Probably the most difficult part was understand hit detection for the paddles and reversing the speed of the ball. <br>

                    <p>For this section, I wanted to make interactive svgs that the user can play around with.<br>
                        
                    The goal was to make an illustration that accounted for real-world elements and minor user activity. The original concept was to have a full workspace with a computer that performed some sort of animation and a other small actions. But due to time constraints, I made a clock that read that current time current and displayed it in real-time.<br>
                        
                    I wanted to make the lamp a toggle button where if the user clicked on it, then the room would go dark and a light would come out of it; however, it proved too problematic in the time that I had and left it alone. <br>

                    <a href = "mixer.html"><h2>Mixer Demo</h2></a>
                    <p>This demo proved to be the most difficult to work with due to all the math and in-depth JavaScript involved. The goal was to create an audio visualizer with sliders that users could interact with that effected the pitch and volume but earlier on I realized that wasn't going to happen.<br>
                    Eventually, I stuck with the main focus of that idea and made a visualizer based on a mp3 file that a user would upload. I wanted to have like a sample file that could be played to avoid all the extra effort, but ultimately I couldn't get that to work without causing some other errors. <br>
                    Despite the difficulty involved, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do something a little ambitous. After seeing how particular making a visualizer is, I know now that the world of JavaScript is a whole other realm.<br>
